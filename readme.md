## Street Fighter II demo 
This is a cool experiment I made up while hacking with the steps() parameter of CSS animations. Here's the tutorial I wrote on [David Walsh's blog](http://davidwalsh.name/street-fighter) and here is the popular [CodePen](http://codepen.io/jkneb/pen/smtHA) wich goes with the tutorial.

This master branch has a bit more stuff in it than the codepen demo. I added sound effects, background music and started to implement a basic collision detection for "a second player".

Please fork it, hack it and finish it :P It's made with very basic css and js code, no canvas or stuff like this. I which I could have enough time to code all the cool features I want for this demo :P
